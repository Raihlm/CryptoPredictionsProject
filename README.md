#  Crypto Price Predictor 

A project for learning Machine Learning to predict Bitcoin price
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Project Description
This project built as part of learning about how we could apply machine learning model in financial industry and learn about cryptocurrency. We Build This Project by:
 - Using historical data from 2010 until 6 June 2025
 - Pulling realtime data automatically from coingecko API every 24 hours at 12PM ( On Progress )
 - predict next day, next week,next month and year 
 - Integrating Sentiment Analysis ( On Progress )

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Feature
- Predict next day price (main Features)
- we predict next week, month, year based on the next day price prediction * some np.random for estimating technique and because our model has it weak on predicting a long time.
- the dashboard integrate realtime price from coingecko that update every 1 minute
- visualitation of historical data with candlestick and line charts
- confidence(from R Square * 100) and round it (for example our linear regression is 99,97% it rounded to 100), and model evaluation.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
  We use to take historical data manually, and realtime data from API.

- **SOURCE**: 
Historical : [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/bitcoin/historical-data), 
API        : [Coingecko](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/),

- **Format**: CSV(historical data)

- **Time Span**: Juni 2010 â€“ 6 June 2025

- **Update**: Data real-time akan diambil setiap hari jam 12 siang dari Coingecko menggunakan WebSocket API, dan disimpan di folder `Dataset/Historical/`. ( belum bisa )

python -m uvicorn app:app --reload

```bash
### Project RunDown

DoneProgress:
âœ… Gathering Historical Dataset (2010â€“2025)

âœ… Explorating Daily, weekly, monnthly, yearly data

âœ… Training Predictions model using Linear Regression And Random Forest

âœ… Model Evaluation

âœ… Predict next day, week, month, year price

âœ… Creating dashboard using html css js

âœ… Integrating model and predictions to dashboard using FastAPI

ðŸ”œ fetch realtime data to historical data

ðŸ”œ sentiment analysis ( on progress )

ðŸ”œ View Historical Predictions ( Still Bug & on progress )
```

# Purpose & Reason To Create THis project

This project created for us to learn how to build machine learning model from zero, to useful usecase.
Develop our data analyst skill, making pipieline, also training and learn how to integrate backend to frontend
Realizing a dynamic prediction system based on th realtime data
And open a chance for integrating to a financial dashboard application on the future


# Technology we use:
Python 3.13.1

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, mplfinance â€“ for analysis and visualizing.

Scikit-learn â€“ for building machine learning model

WebSocket (coingecko API) â€“ pulling realtime data
